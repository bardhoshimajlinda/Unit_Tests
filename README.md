# Testing Examples
This repository contains a set of exercises related to software testing. The exercises cover various aspects of unit testing using Java and the JUnit testing framework.

## Calculator Class
The Calculator class is implemented with basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The corresponding CalculatorTest class includes unit tests for each operation to ensure their correctness.

## ArrayExample Class
The ArrayExample class provides a method to remove duplicates from a string array. The removal of duplicates is tested using the TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach, where test cases are created first before implementing the method.

## EmailValidator Class
The EmailValidator class includes a method to validate email addresses. The validation is performed using unit tests to ensure that valid email addresses are accepted, and invalid ones are rejected.

## Account Class
The Account class simulates a bank account with fields such as balance, account number, and owner's name. The AccountTest class contains unit tests that check the correctness of account transfers, validate account numbers, and ensure that the account balance is correctly updated.

## Shopping Cart Application
The shopping cart application consists of classes representing books and a shopping cart. The Book class includes information about the title, author, and price. The Basket class manages a list of books, allowing users to add books to the cart, view the cart's contents, and calculate the total price.

## File Operations (FileManager Class)
The FileManager class simulates file operations, including file creation, writing, reading, and cleanup. Test cases cover the creation and deletion of files, writing and reading content, and ensuring proper cleanup.

## Contact Manager Application
This project includes a simple Contact Manager application. With a Contact class for contact representation and a ContactManager class for contact management. The comprehensive JUnit 5 test suite in the ContactManagerTest class covers various scenarios, including contact creation, validation, and parameterized tests.
